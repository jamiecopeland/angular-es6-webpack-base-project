#Angular ES6 Webpack base project


###Notes
Fully functional but in need of some refinement. (See Roadmap)

###Roadmap
- Move auto generated CSS out of index.html and into its own file
- Separate project and library code
- Switch from JSHint to ESLint
- Add system notifications for Webpack compilation errors

###Thanks
Much wisdom borrowed from [ShMcK's tutorials and examples](https://github.com/ShMcK/WebpackAngularDemos)
